      I'm currently working as a principal software engineer at Mirantis. With 10+ years of experience, I've filled various distinct technical roles. Very interested in the intersection of software engineering, automation, resilience, security, and distributed systems.

      Outside of tech, I'm interested in music, photography, good food, and maintaining an active lifestyle.
